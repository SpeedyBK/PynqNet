# PynqNet

The PynqNet project will contain IP-Cores which allow to use the eathernet port (Realtek RTL8211E) on Zynq-Devices to get data to
and from the device. In the first place it will be a hardware solution, which can be configured by the Zynq-Processing-System via 
an Axi-Lite-Port or hardcoded by generics. The final desicion how the data will be handled is not made yet.

Currenty it is not working and WIP.
