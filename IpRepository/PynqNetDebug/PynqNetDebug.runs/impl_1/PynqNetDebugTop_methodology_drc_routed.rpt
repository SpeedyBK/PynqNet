TIMING-17#8 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin count_reg[7]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#9 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin count_reg[8]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#10 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin out_o_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell out_o_i_4, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) count_reg[0]/CLR, count_reg[1]/CLR, count_reg[2]/CLR, count_reg[3]/CLR, count_reg[4]/CLR, count_reg[5]/CLR, count_reg[6]/CLR, count_reg[7]/CLR, count_reg[8]/CLR, out_o_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
